# Automated Circuit Matrix Analyzer

This MATLAB-based tool automates the formulation of circuit matrices (based on the modified nodal analysis method provided below) for electrical circuits comprising resistors and voltage sources. The algorithm uses nodal analysis and a defined sign convention (current flows from the positive to negative terminal) to generate a matrix representation of the circuit.
## Motivation

Developed as an academic project, this tool streamlines circuit analysis by automating the tedious process of formulating circuit equations. It is especially useful for educational purposes and preliminary design verification in electrical engineering.

## Features
- **Automated Nodal Analysis:** Automatically identifies unique nodes and voltage sources.
- **User-Defined Circuit Components:** Accepts resistors and voltage sources with terminal definitions.
- **Structured Matrix Formulation:** Computes the circuit matrix to aid in subsequent analysis.
- **Clear Sign Conventions:** Ensures correct current direction based on the battery's positive and negative terminals.
## How It Works

1. **Input Definition:**  
   Users define circuit components (resistors and voltage sources) with associated parameters and node assignments. Terminals are entered as numeric values, with ground represented as 0.

2. **Node and Branch Identification:**  
   The algorithm identifies all unique nodes and voltage sources in the circuit, grouping components accordingly.

3. **Matrix Formulation:**  
   A system matrix is generated by applying nodal analysis principles, where each element corresponds to the conductance (for resistors) or connection orientation (for voltage sources) between nodes.

4. **Output:**  
   The resulting matrix can then be used for further circuit analysis or simulation.
